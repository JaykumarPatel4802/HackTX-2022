Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post. Closed 3 years ago. Improve this question I'm running a application using selenium, and I want to know actual chrome browser version installed, before running Chrome Driver to avoid any Exception for compatibility reason. I know I can use driver = webdriver.Chrome("path\\to\\chromedriver.exe") then driver.capabilities['browserVersion'] to show version but if Chrome Driver version differ from actual chrome browser version that's raise an exception. Thanks Edited: Actually I found the answer for myself, the solution I found: from win32com.client import Dispatch def get_version_via_com(filename): parser = Dispatch("Scripting.FileSystemObject") try: version = parser.GetFileVersion(filename) except Exception: return None return version if __name__ == "__main__": paths = [r"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe", r"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"] version = list(filter(None, [get_version_via_com(p) for p in paths]))[0] print(version) # result: 80.0.3987.122 PS: I think people don't understand my question at the beginning and I'm sorry for my english pythongoogle-chromeselenium-chromedriver Share Improve this question Follow edited May 28, 2020 at 13:43 temascal 284 4 bronze badges asked Aug 10, 2019 at 10:44 leminhnguyen 1,1782 2 gold badges 10 10 silver badges 17 17 bronze badges Did you find a solution?
