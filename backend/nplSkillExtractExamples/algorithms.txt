Responsibilities Design and develop infrastructure/pipelines to build end-to-end perception systems. Depending on the specific project, this may involve training and evaluating deep learning models, data processing, and productionization of prototype systems. Optimize algorithms run-time efficiency and integrate in the product platform. Write production-quality C++, Python code and tests.
